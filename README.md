## Overview

The **Spatial Asset Management Platform** is an enterprise-style backend application designed to manage, monitor, and analyze geographically distributed assets such as **vehicles, drones, IoT devices, sensors, and field equipment**.

Modern organizations increasingly rely on location-aware systems to manage assets like delivery vehicles, drones, surveillance cameras, and sensors — and these systems need more than basic CRUD operations. They need secure access control, accurate geospatial analysis, historical tracking, and a backend architecture that can scale. This platform is built to address exactly that.

It combines secure authentication, geospatial intelligence, asset lifecycle management, analytics, audit logging, and location history into a scalable RESTful backend, following a clean **Layered Architecture** (`API → Service → Repository → Database`). Business logic is fully separated from database operations, keeping the codebase modular, maintainable, and easy to test.

Unlike a typical asset management CRUD app, this platform's spatial capabilities are powered by **PostGIS**, enabling nearby-asset discovery, nearest-asset lookup, geofence detection, buffer analysis, route calculations, polygon operations, and distance measurement — all executed efficiently inside PostgreSQL.

The current implementation is backend-only, but the API is designed to integrate cleanly with any modern frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue), making the platform suitable for full-stack applications in logistics, fleet management, smart cities, agriculture, industrial monitoring, and IoT ecosystems.

**Current Version:** `v1.0.0` &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Project Type:** Backend REST API &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Architecture:** Layered (API → Service → Repository → Database) &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Status:** Production-ready backend

## System Architecture & Workflows

The platform follows a **Layered Architecture**, separating the application into independent layers responsible for request handling, business logic, data access, and persistence. This improves scalability, maintainability, readability, and testability while keeping business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns.

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client<br/>Swagger / Postman / Future Frontend]
    FastAPIApp[FastAPI Application]
    Auth[JWT Authentication]
    Router[API Routers]
    Service[Service Layer]
    Repository[Repository Layer]
    ORM[SQLAlchemy ORM]
    DB[(PostgreSQL + PostGIS)]

    Client --> FastAPIApp --> Auth --> Router --> Service --> Repository --> ORM --> DB
    DB --> ORM --> Repository --> Service --> Router --> Client
```

### The Four Layers

| Layer            | Responsibility                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| API Layer        | Handles HTTP requests and responses      |
| Service Layer    | Implements business logic and validation |
| Repository Layer | Performs all database operations         |
| Database Layer   | Stores relational and spatial data       |

**Request lifecycle:**

1. The client sends an HTTP request to an API router.
2. The request passes through JWT authentication and role-based authorization.
3. The router calls the relevant service method.
4. The service layer applies business logic and calls the repository layer.
5. The repository executes SQLAlchemy / PostGIS queries against PostgreSQL.
6. The result flows back up through repository → service → router.
7. The API returns a JSON response to the client.

### Authentication Workflow

---

## Database Design

The platform uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary relational database and **PostGIS** as its spatial extension for storing and querying geographic data. The schema supports secure user management, asset lifecycle operations, spatial analysis, historical location tracking, and audit logging while maintaining data integrity and scalability.

| `latitude` / `longitude` | Previous coordinates |
| `recorded_at`            | Time of update       |

### Spatial Data

Instead of storing only latitude and longitude, every asset also stores a **PostGIS geometry point**:

```text
POINT(longitude latitude)

-- Example
POINT(76.6394 12.2958)
```

This enables efficient execution of advanced spatial operations directly inside PostgreSQL — reducing application-side computation and improving performance. Supported operations include `ST_DWithin`, `ST_Distance`, `ST_Buffer`, `ST_Area`, `ST_Centroid`, `ST_Length`, `ST_Contains`, and `ST_Intersects`.

### Entity Relationships

- **Users → Assets**: one user can own many assets.
- **Users → Audit Logs**: one user can generate many audit records.
- **Assets → Audit Logs**: one asset can generate many audit events.
- **Assets → Location History**: one asset can have many historical location records.

### Soft Delete Strategy

Assets are never permanently deleted. Instead, the platform uses a soft-delete flag:

- `deleted_at = NULL` → asset is active
- `deleted_at = <timestamp>` → asset is soft-deleted

This preserves historical information while hiding deleted assets from normal queries.

### Database Design Goals

- Maintain data integrity through relational design
- Support advanced geospatial operations using PostGIS
- Preserve historical information through soft deletion
- Record system activity with audit logging
- Track asset movement using location history
- Enable scalable querying through normalized relationships
- Provide a strong foundation for future frontend and analytics integrations

## Project Structure

The platform follows a modular, layered project structure that separates business logic, API routing, data access, validation, authentication, and configuration into independent components — improving maintainability, scalability, and readability.

## API Documentation

The platform exposes a comprehensive RESTful API for secure asset management, advanced geospatial analysis, dashboard reporting, analytics, audit logging, and historical location tracking. The API follows REST principles, exchanges data in JSON, and is automatically documented via **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc**.

### Authentication

All protected endpoints require a **JWT** access token, obtained via login and sent on subsequent requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Prerequisites

| Software       | Recommended Version |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Python         | 3.11 or later       |
| PostgreSQL     | 16 or later         |
| PostGIS        | Latest              |
| Docker         | Latest              |
| Docker Compose | Latest              |
| Git            | Latest              |

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhanushgowdars/Spatial-Asset-Management-Platform.git
cd Spatial-Asset-Management-Platform
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

**Windows**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the provided example file:

**Windows**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update `.env` with your local PostgreSQL configuration:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://geouser:yourpassword@localhost:5432/geoasset_db

# JWT Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# PostgreSQL Configuration
POSTGRES_USER=geouser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
POSTGRES_DB=geoasset_db
```

> **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file. Only commit `.env.example` with placeholder values.

### 5. Start PostgreSQL + PostGIS with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d      # start
docker ps                 # verify the container is running
docker compose logs       # view logs
docker compose down       # stop
```

### 6. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 7. Run the Application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, with interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI) and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` (ReDoc).

### 8. Try It Out

1. Register a new user via `/users/register`.
2. Log in via `/users/login` to receive a JWT.
3. Authorize in Swagger UI with `Bearer <access_token>`.
4. Create assets, run spatial queries, and explore the dashboard/analytics endpoints.

### Development Workflow (Quick Reference)

```text

## Project Preview

Since the frontend hasn't been built yet, this section reflects the project's current, honest state: a fully functional backend with interactive API documentation.

**Swagger UI** — `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

- Interactive API testing, request/response schemas, JWT auth support, full endpoint documentation

**ReDoc** — `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

- Clean, readable API reference with request and response models

> A dedicated frontend application is planned. Once it's built, screenshots and usage examples (home page, login/register, dashboard, asset map, analytics) will be added here.

---

## Testing

The project includes automated integration tests covering the core backend functionality:

- Authentication
- Authorization (RBAC)
- Asset CRUD operations
- Search, filtering & pagination
- Dashboard APIs
- Analytics APIs
- Audit log APIs
- Location history APIs
- Geospatial operations
- Health check endpoints

```bash
pytest                                          # run the full suite
pytest -v                                       # verbose output
pytest tests/test_assets.py                     # run a specific file
pytest tests/test_assets.py::test_create_asset  # run a specific test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**PostgreSQL connection failed**

- Verify PostgreSQL is running and the PostGIS extension is installed.
- Double-check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

**Docker container not running**

```bash
docker ps
docker compose up -d
```

**Migration errors**

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Missing Python packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Port already in use**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```
